Hello and welcome to Flippy Bard, a new twist on the classic Flappy Bird! The name was chosen with care to reflect my unique take on the game.

Currently available exclusively for macOS, Flippy Bard is easy to start playing. Simply download and unzip the .app.zip file, double-click the application, and you're ready to go. Click "Start" to begin your adventure.

Controls are simple:

Press the up arrow or spacebar to make Flippy jump.
Navigate through the pipes to score points.
Need a break? Press the escape key or click on the pause menu to pause the game. An overlay will appear with two options: "Resume" to continue your game or "Quit" to exit. You can also resume the game by pressing escape or clicking the resume button in the top right corner.

Flippy Bard features a high score system that saves your best score on your computer. When you relaunch the game, your high score will be loaded automatically.

Enjoy your time with Flippy Bard!
